## Introduction
This is the online repository for the Heliot CDSS, which contains the replication package of our experiments.
The repository is organized into several directories:

| Directory                     | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`heliot_cdss`](/heliot_cdss)     | Contains the core logic of the Heliot CDSS, the web application, and the REST API server.              |
| [`heliot_pipeline`](/heliot_pipeline)               | Includes all the necessary scripts for the data pipeline. |

Each directory contains its own README.md file, providing detailed information on how to set up and run the scripts.
